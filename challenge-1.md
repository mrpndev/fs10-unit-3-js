# In-Class Challenge: User Intake Logic Builder

Please build it in your unit-3 folder but outside of js folder.

## Objective
Practice:
- Variables
- Data types
- Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
- Conditionals (`if`, `else if`, `else`)

You will write a small program that evaluates a user and prints decisions to the console.

---

## Scenario

You are building intake logic for a financial platform.

The system needs to determine:

1. If the user is eligible to open an account
2. If they qualify for a premium account
3. If they should be flagged for review

---

## Requirements

### Step 1 — Create Variables

Declare the following variables:

- `firstName` (string)
- `age` (number)
- `annualIncome` (number)
- `creditScore` (number)
- `isCitizen` (boolean)
- `hasCriminalRecord` (boolean)

Assign them realistic values.

---

### Step 2 — Basic Eligibility

A user can open an account if:

- They are at least 18 years old
- They are a citizen
- They do NOT have a criminal record

Print:

- `"Account Approved"`  
OR  
- `"Account Denied"`

---

### Step 3 — Premium Qualification

A user qualifies for premium if:

- Income is greater than 100000
- Credit score is 720 or higher
- Account was approved

Print:

- `"Premium Approved"`
OR  
- `"Standard Account Only"`

---

### Step 4 — Risk Flag

Flag the user for manual review if:

- Credit score is below 600  
OR  
- Income is below 25000  

Print:

- `"Flag for Review"`
OR  
- `"No Risk Flags"`

---

## Stretch Goals (Optional)

1. Create a variable `riskLevel`:
   - `"High"` if credit < 550
   - `"Medium"` if credit between 550–650
   - `"Low"` otherwise

2. Use string interpolation to print:
