# In-Class Challenge: Transaction Analyzer (Loops + Functions)

## Objective
Practice:
- Functions
- Parameters & return values
- Loops (`for` or `while`)
- Conditionals
- Accumulators

You will build a small transaction analyzer for a banking system.

---

## Scenario

You are given a list of transactions (positive numbers = deposits, negative numbers = withdrawals).

Your program must:

1. Calculate total balance
2. Count total deposits
3. Count total withdrawals
4. Detect suspicious activity
5. Print a summary

---

## Step 1 — Create the Data

Create an array called `transactions` with at least 8 numbers.

Example:

```js
const transactions = [250, -100, 400, -50, -300, 1200, -20, 75];
```

You may use your own values.

---

## Step 2 — Build These Functions

### 1️⃣ `calculateBalance(transactions)`

- Loop through the array
- Add all values together
- Return the total balance

---

### 2️⃣ `countDeposits(transactions)`

- Loop through the array
- Count how many numbers are greater than 0
- Return the count

---

### 3️⃣ `countWithdrawals(transactions)`

- Loop through the array
- Count how many numbers are less than 0
- Return the count

---

### 4️⃣ `detectLargeWithdrawal(transactions)`

- If any withdrawal is less than -500
- Return `"Suspicious Activity Detected"`
- Otherwise return `"No Suspicious Activity"`

---

## Step 3 — Use the Functions

Store the returned values in variables:

- `balance`
- `depositCount`
- `withdrawalCount`
- `securityStatus`

---

## Step 4 — Print Summary

Output something like:

```
Account Summary
---------------
Balance: 1455
Deposits: 4
Withdrawals: 4
Security Status: No Suspicious Activity
```

---

## Rules

- Must use at least one loop inside each function
- Functions must return values (not just console.log)
- No built-in methods like `.reduce()`
- Use conditionals properly
- Clean indentation

---

## Stretch Goals (Optional)

1. Create a function `getAverageTransaction(transactions)`
2. Create a function `getLargestDeposit(transactions)`
3. Modify `detectLargeWithdrawal` to stop looping immediately once suspicious activity is found

---

## Deliverable

Submit a single `.js` file that:

- Runs without errors
- Calls every function
- Prints a formatted summary
